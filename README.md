# SmartPacer-UI ðŸ’»


![Badge em Desenvolvimento](https://img.shields.io/badge/Status-Developing-yellowgreen)


To control the management of Teams and processes related to the API, a document called PACER is designated for team members to self-evaluate and evaluate their Masters based on the current Sprint score.

The filling was done using Excel and sent to the Professor responsible for the API. With the purpose of maximizing the process, we will develop a Software that calculates the Pacer grades, making the process more practical for both sides, teacher and student.
